# Java-Clusters-and-Lines-Project

This is a group project I was a part of that used Java and Java Swing. It first creates a GUI which
allows the user to place dots on the screen by clicking anywhere in the gray area. There are then menu
options on the top of the screen which have a couple different functions. The 'File' option allows the user 
to save their current workspace, load a previous workspace, and clear their current workspace. 
The next section 'Connections' lets user create lines between the dots, clusters of dots, or both. When 
'lines' is selected, the program will draw one consecutive line connecting all the dots. When 'Clusters' 
is selected, the program will ask you how many clusters you'd like; after that the program will 
seperate the dots into different colored groups, depeninding on which dots are closest to each other. Then
the 'Clusters + lines' options will combine these two and perform both actions. Lastly, the 'Help' menu
option will show the user an about page for the project.
